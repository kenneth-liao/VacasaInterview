Large drift logs dot the shoreline here and huge rocks are seen offshore.
Castle Rock National Wildlife Refuge is a great offshore bird and sea lion watching spot and it’s best viewed from northern Pebble Beach. Continuing north there are more roadside parking areas with hiking trails on the bluff and eventually the road ends at Point Saint George.",-1
